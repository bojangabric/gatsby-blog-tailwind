## Gatsby project template with blog posts and tailwindcss

### üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/bojangabric/gatsby-blog-tailwind
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-blog-tailwind
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

### üßê Files you should change

1.  **`config.js`**: This file contains all of the configs related to the creator of the site.

2.  **`/static/*`**: This folder contains the favicon for the site and the photo that's being used in social media cards.
